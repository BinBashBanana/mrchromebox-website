# Reverting to Stock ChromeOS

::: warning
If your device has hit AUE (Automatic Update Expiration), you will not be able to restore the stock ChromeOS firmware using the [Firmware Utility Script](/docs/fwscript.md); see the [FAQ](/docs/faq.md#misc)
:::

## Requirements

- A PC or laptop to make a ChromeOS recovery USB.
- An external drive like a USB drive or SD card that is at least 8GB.
- Another external drive that contains your stock ROM backup (If backup is avaliable).
- An understanding that this guide has the potential to brick your device.

You can revert your firmware back to stock and reinstall ChromeOS.

This is useful if your planning to sell your device.

::: tip NOTE
If you only flashed RW_LEGACY firmware to your device, there is no need to flash the stock firmware back on the device -- you're already running it. Simply perfom a ChromeOS USB recovery and exit Developer Mode.
