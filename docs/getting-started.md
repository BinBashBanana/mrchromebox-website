# Getting Started

::: danger
You are about to make **unsupported** changes to your device that will in many cases **void any warranty**. MrChromebox firmware and utilities are provided **as-is, without any guarantee**.
Any and all changes are made **at your own risk**!
:::

::: warning IMPORTANT
If your device is currently managed/enrolled by a organization (such as a school or employer), then you do not own the device, and you should not be modifying it in any way without direct, express, written permission.

## Prerequisites

* An x86_86 (Intel/AMD) architecture device -- ARM-based devices are not supported
* The device's Hardware ID (HWID) / ChromeOS board name
    * The device's HWID can be found at the bottom of the Recovery Mode and Developer Mode screens, as well as by going to `chrome://system` in the browser and searching for `HWID`
* To actually own the Chromebook -- devices managed by a school or company generally are locked down and cannot be switched to Developer Mode
* A basic understanding of how the firmware and boot process on ChromeOS devices differs from Windows PC's, so that you understand the changes being made
* Familiarity with command line input / how to use a terminal/command prompt
* A few USB flash drives which you can format/overwrite as needed
* Another (non-mobile) device in case things go sideways and you need to recover

::: warning
It cannot be stressed enough: **This is NOT a one click procedure**. Modifying your device's firmware is serious business.
Following a Youtube video or blog post with "simplified" instructions will only end in tears.

## Asking for help properly

If you are facing a issue, please read the [FAQ](faq.md) first.


**Do not use manufacturer's model name or serial number when asking for help** (i.e: HP Chromebook 14a), it doesn't help with identifying the machine. Provide the HWID/boardname, otherwise your support request will be ignored.
